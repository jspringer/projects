# Projects

Due to the amount of repositories on my account, I made this list as a shortcut to the stand out apps. If you want to see the full list, visit my [repositories](https://github.com/jspringer?tab=repositories) or [homepage](http://jasonspringer.me/#projects). For more details on how the apps are used and set up, see the README file in the root of each project, which will load by default when you click on the project link. If the websites require logging in or making purchases to fully test, that info can be found there as well.
